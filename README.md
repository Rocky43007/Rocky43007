# Welcome!

I'm a second-year Computer Science undergrad at Stony Brook University. I'm a full-stack engineer who loves working with everything, from hardware to software. I've been programming for almost ten years and have loved it since I started in 2014. 

## Some projects I've worked on over the years:
- **[Glasess For the Blind](https://github.com/Rocky43007/GlassesForBlind):** One of my more involved projects, this initiative aimed to create affordable, effective glasses for visually impaired individuals using Python, OpenCV, and OpenVINO with Intel NCS2.
- **[Shader Editor](https://github.com/nanovis/Shader-Editor):** This is a fun project using the new WebGPU Shading Language (WGSL). I worked on the site's editor by implementing what is basically [VS Code](https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor).
- **[Universal OS](https://github.com/Rocky43007/UniversalOS):** An ambitious project to develop an operating system capable of running Windows, Mac, and Linux applications natively without compatibility layers like WINE or WSL. The kernel loads some text in 32-bit, but it's currently under hiatus.
- **[EmoStyleGan](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fNYO3z1301oJ4RnGusKv92-sMIYPSSJaMcnEasbrTbA/view):** A model that generated fake AI art with an emotional condition, made back in 2021. It modified the Nvidia [StyleGAN 2](https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan2) architecture to take an additional argument of an emotion.

## Currently working on:
- **[Spacedrive](https://github.com/spacedriveapp/spacedrive):** Currently, I'm a Full Stack Engineer - Intern @ Spacedrive. Spacedrive is an open-source cross-platform file explorer powered by a virtual distributed filesystem written in Rust.
